<h1>MQTT DOORBELL USING ESP32 AND ESP8266</h1>

This project uses an ESP32 and an ESP8266 NodeMCU to communicate via MQTT within a local network. <br/>
-
* Out of the two boards, the ESP32 acts as the doorbell switch and the ESP8266 acts as the MQTT broker as well as the receiver unit for the doorbell.
  * The ESP32 provides visual feedback by blinking an LED on the press of the doorbell button (connected to the board) and sends out the MQTT message, notifying the bell press.
  * The ESP8266 runs the MQTT broker to circulate the MQTT message to subscribed clients, while also acting as the receiver unit for the doorbell, providing audio-visual feedback.
* All clients connected to the ESP8266 MQTT Broker will receive the message and alerts can be set up accordingly.
* Please ensure to modify the credentials on the respective codes

<h2>DOORBELL RECEIVER</h2>

* **Modify the SSID and Password**
https://github.com/Ricky-001/MQTT_Doorbell/blob/5ee4b4eb8552d3b1abdc83b6b3c202e939a1ce0d/MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_receiver_mqttbroker/doorbell_receiver_mqttbroker.ino#L33-L34
of your home Wi-Fi (or the Wi-Fi you want the connected devices on)
* **Modify the MQTT UserID and MQTT Password**
https://github.com/Ricky-001/MQTT_Doorbell/blob/5ee4b4eb8552d3b1abdc83b6b3c202e939a1ce0d/MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_receiver_mqttbroker/doorbell_receiver_mqttbroker.ino#L30-L31 
to the credentials you would like to use *(all clients need to use these credentials to connect and communicate/ listen to messages)*
  
* This code uses the [sMQTTBroker library](https://github.com/terrorsl/sMQTTBroker) to convert an ESP8266 NodeMCU into an MQTT broker on a local network, connected by Wi-Fi to enable MQTT communications over the local network.

* The ESP8266 will act as the MQTT broker, while also processing the incoming message for the doorbell press
* Thus it acts as the doorbell's receiver unit, providing audio-visual feedback. 

* The audio is played using the [ESP8266Audio libraries](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio).
* The audio data is directly fed into the *doorbell.h* header file as a hex code.
* The audio file should be in WAV format, 16-bit PCM before converting the contents into Hex and pasting the contents into [doorbell.h](MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_receiver_mqttbroker/doorbell.h)

<h2>DOORBELL SWITCH</h2>

[doorbell_with_deep_sleep [ESP32]](MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_with_deep_sleep/doorbell_with_deep_sleep.ino)

* This code uses the [PubSubClient library](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) to convert an ESP32 into an MQTT client
  that sends specific MQTT messages over the local network on the press of a button, which acts as the doorbell.

* The ESP32 remains in deep sleep while not in use but comes online, connects to Wi-Fi & MQTT and sends the MQTT message to a broker on the local network using pre-defined credentials
* **Modify the SSID and Password**
https://github.com/Ricky-001/MQTT_Doorbell/blob/5ee4b4eb8552d3b1abdc83b6b3c202e939a1ce0d/MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_with_deep_sleep/doorbell_with_deep_sleep.ino#L19-L20
 of your home Wi-Fi (or the Wi-Fi you want the connected devices on)
* **Modify the MQTT UserID and MQTT Password** 
https://github.com/Ricky-001/MQTT_Doorbell/blob/5ee4b4eb8552d3b1abdc83b6b3c202e939a1ce0d/MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_with_deep_sleep/doorbell_with_deep_sleep.ino#L19-L20
to whatever is set on the Broker code
* **Modify the IP address to that of your MQTT Broker on the local network**
https://github.com/Ricky-001/MQTT_Doorbell/blob/5ee4b4eb8552d3b1abdc83b6b3c202e939a1ce0d/MQTT_Doorbell/doorbell_with_deep_sleep/doorbell_with_deep_sleep.ino#L22

## **Circuit Diagrams**

### **1. ESP32 (Doorbell Switch)**
The circuit includes an LED and a button. The ESP32 enters deep sleep when idle and wakes up when the button is pressed.

### **2. ESP8266 (Receiver and Speaker)**
The circuit uses a transistor to amplify audio output for a speaker.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

1. **Wi-Fi Connection Issues:**
   - Ensure your Wi-Fi SSID and password are entered correctly in both sketches.
   - Check if the ESP32 and ESP8266 are within range of the Wi-Fi router.
   - Ensure the Wi-Fi network operates on 2.4 GHz (not 5 GHz).

2. **MQTT Communication Issues:**
   - Verify that the ESP8266 is running the MQTT broker successfully by subscribing to its IP using a client app (e.g., MQTT Explorer or MQTT.fx).
   - Double-check the MQTT credentials in both the broker and the client code.

3. **Audio Playback Issues on ESP8266:**
   - Ensure your speaker wiring matches the schematic.
   - Verify that the audio file in `doorbell.h` is correctly converted to hex and is in the right format (16-bit PCM WAV).

---

## **Testing the Setup**

1. **Power Up the ESP8266:**
   - Once flashed, connect the ESP8266 to a 5V power source.
   - It should start running the MQTT broker.

2. **Power Up the ESP32:**
   - Press the button on the ESP32. The LED should blink, and an MQTT message should be sent.

3. **Verify MQTT Message Reception:**
   - Use a mobile app like [MQTT Alert](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gigiosoft.MQTTAlert) or [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) to subscribe to the MQTT broker on the ESP8266's IP address.
   - Check if the doorbell message appears under the topic `home/doorbell`.

---

## **Setting Up Mobile Alerts**

Apps like **MQTT Alert** can notify you on your smartphone when the doorbell is pressed:
1. Install the app from the Play Store.
2. Add a new connection with the following settings:
   - **Broker IP**: IP address of the ESP8266.
   - **Port**: 1883.
   - **Username/Password**: As set in your ESP8266 MQTT Broker code.
   - **Topic**: `home/doorbell`.
3. Set up a notification tone to play when the message is received on the above topic.
4. You should be good to go. You'll receive mobile notifications each time your doorbell is pressed!
